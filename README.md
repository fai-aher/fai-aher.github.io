### My description

I consider discipline is one of my greatest qualities as it is the pilar of my everyday behavior. I find learning being one of my main passions in life and I could describe myself as a lifelong learner. Currently, I am acquiring soft and technic skills through college and self-learning strategies. 

I am a physically active person, I dedicate some time everyday for exercising and sometimes gather with other people to play volleyball.

I like staying up to date with news around the world, watching videos related to geography and geopolitic topics, reading classic literature books, learning japanese through news, articles and university lessons, talking and meeting people as I consider I can get some valuable learning from everyone with just a short conversation. Social interaction in my life is as important as any other activity, I feel at ease when I get the opportunity to spare time with collegues or friends, no matter if it is because of work or leisure.
